Arduino-NXT-brick
=================

This project originated as part of the University of Edinburgh System Design Project '13 (SDP) Group 8's solution for a robotics football tournament.

The idea is to use an Arduino board, arbitrary number of Atmel ATMega 328 microprocessors, a serial Bluetooth communication and Lego NXT connectors in order to create an extensible replacement for the Lego NXT brick with equal levels of precision and an arbitrary amount of I/O.
